# CPU Lightmap Compiler for Counter-Strike 2 SDK

## IMPORTANT!
1. **You need to have .NET 8 installed for it to work** (for now. self-contained one-file executables are too big to justify for a simple tool like this)
2. This is <b>not an overhaul or a recreation</b> of Valve's ResourceCompiler or VRad. This tool just makes it easier to build your maps without a raytracing graphics card as it has made been a requirement to create and build maps for Counter-Strike 2.
3. You can't build <i>only entities</i> with this tool as hammer supports it without a raytracing graphics card. Adding this would be a very redundant feature.
4. **Some lighting features are not supported when compiling with CPU such as illuminating textures/models etc.**

## How to use
Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/the2dguy/CS2-CPU-Lightmapping/releases).
The UI should be familiar to you as it has been intentionally made to mimic the UI of the Hammer-5 build screen.

sorry for bad code
